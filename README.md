The sensor is Freya's eyes and ears in the vivarium - the hardware that enables measurement of environmental conditions experienced by the inhabitants of the vivarium.

#### Capabilities:
- Temperature
- Relative air humidity
- Barometric pressure
- Air quality (VOC)
- Ambient light (visible spectrum)
- UVA/UVB/UVC (spectral 220-400nm)

## Hardware
Designed with KiCad, the Freya Sensor is a curated collection of high-end integrated circuit sensors for comprehensive environmental monitoring in demanding conditions, with repairability and growth in mind.

#### Bosch BME680
I2C Address: **0x76**

Integrated environmental sensor combining temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and VOC gas sensing for air quality monitoring. **[Datasheet](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme680-ds001.pdf)**

#### Vishay VEML6030
I2C Address: **0x10**

High-accuracy ambient light sensor with spectral response matching the human eye for precise lux measurement and photoperiod management. **[Datasheet](https://www.vishay.com/docs/84366/veml6030.pdf)**

#### ams OSRAM AS7331
I2C Address: **0x74** 

Three-channel spectral UV sensor with separated UVA, UVB, and UVC detection for UV bulb monitoring and safety verification. **[Datasheet](https://look.ams-osram.com/m/1856fd2c69c35605/original/AS7331-Spectral-UVA-B-C-Sensor.pdf)**

#### Power
The sensor module operates internally at 3.3V but accepts 5V input for improved noise immunity over longer cable runs. An on-board voltage regulator (**MIC5225-3.3YM5**) provides clean 3.3V power to all sensor ICs, while a bi-directional level shifter handles I²C communication between the 5V bus and 3.3V sensors.

> [!NOTE]  
> The PCB is finished with a coating for resisting the humid conditions.

## Enclosure

## Software
The sensor driver is a TypeScript/Node.js application that runs as a systemd service on Linux/Debian systems. It provides sensor readings via D-Bus for integration with the Freya Vivarium Control System.

#### Installation
When installing the Freya system, the sensor driver is automatically installed. For manual installation:

```bash
wget -O install.sh https://github.com/Freya-Vivariums/Freya-terra-sensor/releases/latest/download/install.sh
chmod +x ./install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

The service runs automatically and can be monitored with:
```bash
systemctl status io.freya.EnvironmentSensorDriver.service
journalctl -u io.freya.EnvironmentSensorDriver.service -f
```

#### D-Bus Interface
Applications interact with the sensor via D-Bus on the system bus:
- **Service:** `io.freya.EnvironmentSensorDriver`
- **Path:** `/io/freya/EnvironmentSensorDriver`
- **Signals:** `measurement(variable: string, value: string)` - Emits readings for temperature, humidity, pressure, light, UVA, UVB, and UVC
